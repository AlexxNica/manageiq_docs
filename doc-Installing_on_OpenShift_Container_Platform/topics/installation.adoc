== Installing {product-title}

{product-title} can be installed on OpenShift Container Platform in a few quick steps. 

This procedure uses a template to deploy a multi-pod {product-title} appliance with the database stored in a persistent volume on OpenShift Container Platform. It provides a step-by-step setup, including cluster administrative tasks as well as basic user information and commands. 

The ultimate goal of the deployment is to be able to deconstruct the {product-title} appliance into several containers running on a pod or a series of pods. 

[NOTE]
====
Running {product-title} on OpenShift Container Platform is available as a technology preview in this release of {product-title}. For more information on the support scope for features marked as technology preview, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]. Additionally, at this time only one {product-title} instance can be run at one time, and upgrading is unavailable.
====

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

To successfully deploy a {product-title} appliance on OpenShift Container Platform, you need a functioning OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 or newer install with the following configured:

* NFS or other compatible volume provider
* A `cluster-admin` user
* A basic user

The {product-title_short} deployment uses three files to create the appliance: `cfme-template.yaml`, which is the {product-title_short} template used for the deployment, and `cfme-pv-example.yaml` and `cfme-pv-app-example.yaml`, two pod volume files. OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 includes these files by default.

==== Cluster Sizing

To avoid deployment failures due to resource starvation, Red Hat recommends the following minimum cluster size for a test environment:

* 1 master node with at least 8 VCPUs and 12GB of RAM
* 2 nodes with at least 4 VCPUs and 8GB of RAM
* 25GB of storage for {product-title_short} physical volume use

These recommendations assume {product-title_short} is the only application running on this cluster. Alternatively, you can provision an infrastructure node to run registry, metrics, router, and logging pods.

Each {product-title_short} application pod will consume at least 3GB of RAM on initial deployment (without providers added). RAM consumption increases depending on the appliance use. For example, after providers are added, expect higher resource consumption.


[[preparing-for-deployment]]
=== Preparing to Deploy {product-title_short}

To prepare for deploying the {product-title_short} appliance to OpenShift Container Platform, create a project, configure security contexts, and create pod volumes.

. As a basic user, log in to OpenShift: 
+
------
$ oc login -u <user> -p <password>
------
+
. Create a project with your desired parameters. The `<project_name>` is mandatory, but `<description>` and `<display_name>` are optional: 
+
------
$ oc new-project <project_name> \
--description="<description>" \
--display-name="<display_name>"
------
+
. Add the `cfme-anyuid` service account to the `anyuid` security context constraint (SCC). 
+
Because the {product-title_short} image requires the root user, the `cfme-anyuid` service account for your namespace (project) must be added to the `anyuid` SCC before pods using the service account can run as root. 
+
.. As the admin user, add the `cfme-anyuid` service account by running:
+
------
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:cfme-anyuid
------
+
.. Verify that the `cfme-anyuid` service account is now included in the `anyuid` SCC:
+
------
$ oc describe scc anyuid | grep Users
Users:					system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:cfme-anyuid
------
+
. Add your default service account to the `privileged` security context. The default service account for your namespace (project) must be added to the `privileged` security context constraints (SCCs) before they can run privileged pods.
+
.. As the admin user, add the default service account by running:
+
------
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:default
------
+
.. Verify that your default service account is now included in the `privileged` security context constraints (SCCs):
+
------
$ oc describe scc privileged | grep Users
Users:                  system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller,system:serviceaccount:management-infra:management-admin,system:serviceaccount:management-infra:inspector-admin,system:serviceaccount:default:router,system:serviceaccount:default:registry,system:serviceaccount:<your-namespace>:default
------
+
. Prepare persistent storage for the deployment. (Skip this step if you have already configured persistent storage.) 
+
A basic {product-title_short} deployment needs at least two persistent volumes (PVs) to store {product-title_short} data. As the admin user, create two persistent volumes: one to host the {product-title_short} PostgreSQL database, and one to host the application data. 
+
Example NFS-backed volume templates are provided by `cfme-pv-db-example.yaml` and `cfme-pv-server-example.yaml`, available from https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.5/cfme-templates/[GitHub]. Edit settings within the files to match your environment, and at minimum, configure the correct NFS server host and appropriate path.
+
[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends setting permissions for the pv-app (privileged pod volume) as 777, uid/gid 0 (owned by root). For more information on configuring persistent storage in OpenShift Container Platform, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/3.3/single/installation-and-configuration/#configuring-persistent-storage[OpenShift Container Platform Installation and Configuration] guide.	
====
+
.. Run the following commands to create the two persistent volumes: 
+
------
$ oc create -f cfme-pv-db-example.yaml
$ oc create -f cfme-pv-server-example.yaml
------
+
.. Verify the pod volumes were created successfully: 
+
------
$ oc get pv
NAME       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM  REASON   AGE
cfme-pv01   15Gi        RWO           Recycle         Available                   30s
cfme-pv02   5Gi         RWO           Recycle         Available                   19s
------
+
[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends validating NFS share connectivity from an OpenShift node before attempting a deployment.
====
+
. Increase the maximum number of imported images on ImageStream.
+
By default, OpenShift Container Platform can import five tags per image stream, but the {product-title_short} repositories contain more than five images for deployments.
+
You can modify this setting on the master node at `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml` so OpenShift can import additional images. 
+
.. Add the following at the end of the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml` file: 
+
----
...
imagePolicyConfig:
  maxImagesBulkImportedPerRepository: 100
----
+
.. Restart the master service:
+
----
$ systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----



[[deploying-the-appliance]]
=== Deploying the {product-title_short} Appliance

To deploy the appliance on OpenShift Container Platform, create the {product-title} template and verify it is available in your project. 

. As a basic user, create the {product-title} template: 
+
------
$ oc create -f templates/cfme-template.yaml
template "cloudforms" created
------
+
. Verify the template is available with your project: 
+
------
$ oc get templates
NAME         DESCRIPTION                                    PARAMETERS        OBJECTS
cloudforms   CloudForms appliance with persistent storage   18 (1 blank)      12
------
+
. (Optional) Customize the templateâ€™s deployment parameters. Use the following command to see the available parameters and descriptions:
+
------
$ oc process --parameters -n <your-project> cloudforms
------
+
Use the following command to customize the deployment configuration parameters:
+
------
$ oc edit dc/<deployconfig_name>
------
+
. To deploy {product-title} from template using default settings, run: 
+
------
$ oc new-app --template=cloudforms
------
+
Alternatively, to deploy {product-title} from a template using customized settings, add the `-p` option and the desired parameters to the command. For example: 
+
------
$ oc new-app --template=cloudforms -p DATABASE_VOLUME_CAPACITY=2Gi,MEMORY_POSTGRESQL_LIMIT=4Gi,APPLICATION_DOMAIN=hostname
------
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `APPLICATION_DOMAIN` parameter specifies the hostname used to reach the {product-title_short} application, which eventually constructs the route to the {product-title_short} pod. If you do not specify the `APPLICATION_DOMAIN` parameter, the {product-title_short} application will not be accessible after the deployment; however, this can be fixed by changing the route. For more information on OpenShift template parameters, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/dev_guide/templates.html#templates-parameters[OpenShift Container Platform Developer Guide].
====

[[deploying-the-appliance-external-db]]
==== Deploying the {product-title_short} Appliance Using an External Database

Before attempting to deploy {product-title_short} using an external DB deployment, ensure the following conditions are satisfied:

* Your OpenShift cluster can access the external PostgreSQL server
* The {product-title_short} user, password, and role have been created on the external PostgreSQL server
* The intended {product-title_short} database is created and ownership has been assigned to the {product-title_short} user

To deploy the appliance:

. Import the CFME external database template:
+
----
$ oc create -f templates/cfme-template-ext-db.yaml
----
+
. Launch the deployment with the following command. The database server IP is required, and the other settings must match your remote PostgreSQL server.
+
----
$ oc new-app --template=cloudforms-ext-db -p DATABASE_IP=<server_ip> -p DATABASE_USER=<user> -p DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> -p DATABASE_NAME=<database_name>
----

[[verifying-the-configuration]]
=== Verifying the Configuration

Verify the deployment was successful by running the following commands as the user under the {product-title} project/namespace:

[NOTE]
====
The first deployment can take several minutes to complete while OpenShift downloads the necessary images. 
====

. Confirm the {product-title} pod is bound to the correct security context constraints. 
.. List and obtain the name of the `cfme-app` pod: 
+
------
$ oc get pod
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cloudforms-1-fzwzm   1/1       Running   0          4m
memcached-1-6iuxu    1/1       Running   0          4m
postgresql-1-2kxc3   1/1       Running   0          4m
------
+
.. Export the configuration of the pod: 
+
------
$ oc export pod <cfme_pod_name>
------
+
.. Examine the output to verify that `openshift.io/scc` has the value `anyuid`: 
+
------
...
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/scc: anyuid
...
------
+
. Verify the persistent volumes are attached to the `postgresql` and `cfme-app` pods:
+
------
$ oc volume pods --all
pods/postgresql-1-437jg
  pvc/cfme-pgdb-claim (allocated 2GiB) as cfme-pgdb-volume
    mounted at /var/lib/pgsql/data
  secret/default-token-2se06 as default-token-2se06
    mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
pods/cfme-1-s3bnp
  pvc/cfme (allocated 2GiB) as cfme-app-volume
    mounted at /persistent
  secret/default-token-9q4ge as default-token-9q4ge
    mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
------
+
. Check the readiness of the {product-title_short} pod: 
+
[NOTE]
====
Allow approximately five minutes once pods are in running state for {product-title} to start responding on HTTPS.  
====
+
------
$ oc describe pods <cfme_pod_name>
...
Conditions:
  Type      Status
  Ready     True
Volumes:
...
------


[[pod-access-and-routes]]
=== Obtaining Pod Access and Routes

To open a shell on the CloudForms pod, run:
------
$ oc rsh <pod_name> bash -l
------
To obtain host information from the route:
------
$ oc get routes
NAME         HOST/PORT                   PATH                SERVICE      TERMINATION   LABELS
cloudforms   cfme.apps.e2e.example.com  cloudforms:443-tcp   passthrough                app=cloudforms
------
A route should have been deployed via template for HTTPS access on the CloudForms pod. Examine the output and point your web browser to the reported URL/host (in this example, `cfme.apps.e2e.example.com`).
