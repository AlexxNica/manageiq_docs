With the application link:create_app.html[created and the Git repository cloned] to your workstation, you can make code changes to your application locally and deploy the application to the remote server with Git. The basic Git work flow for making changes and deploying your application is:

* Make the necessary changes to your application
* Add and commit those changes on your workstation
* Push those changes to the remote server

After making the changes to your application code, add and commit those changes on your workstation:

----
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "Commit my changes so that I can push them to the remote server"
----

Push the code changes to the remote server with:

----
$ git push
----

Your code changes are then copied to the remote server, and you can view the changes by visiting the public URL of the application.
