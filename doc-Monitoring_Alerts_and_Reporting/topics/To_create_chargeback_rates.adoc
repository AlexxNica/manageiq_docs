= Creating Chargeback Rates

{product-title} allows you to create your own set of computing and storage costs to use for billing.

Chargeback rates can be configured at a single rate or in tiers, where one rate is assigned to one usage range, and another rate is assigned to a different usage range.

You can also assign fixed and variable rates per tier if desired.


== Creating a Chargeback Rate

. Navigate to menu:Cloud Intelligence[Chargeback].
. Click the *Rates* accordion and select either *Compute* or *Storage*.

* Use *Compute* to set chargeback rates for CPU, disk I/O, fixed compute cost, memory, and network I/O items.
* Use *Storage* to set chargeback rates for fixed storage cost and disk storage.
. Click  image:1847.png[] *(Configuration)*,  image:1862.png[] *(Add a new Chargeback Rate)* to create a new chargeback rate.
. Type in a *Description* for the chargeback rate.
. Select a currency.
. For each item that you want to set, type in a rate and select a time option.
. Click *Add*.


== Creating a Tiered Chargeback Rate

Tiered chargeback rates can be configured for either compute and storage usage.

The following example shows a scenario to create a chargeback rate for allocated CPU usage in Euro per week measured by the following tiers, plus fixed and variable costs:

* Tier 1: 0-2 CPU = 1 Euro fixed + 0.5 Euro variable
* Tier 2: 2-4 CPU = 0.8 Euro fixed + 0.4 Euro variable
* Tier 3: 4 CPU and above = 0.6 Euro fixed + 0.2 Euro variable

.Example: Creating a tiered chargeback rate
[example]

. Navigate to menu:Cloud Intelligence[Chargeback].
. Click the *Rates* accordion and select *Compute* to create a CPU chargeback rate.
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] *(Configuration)*,  image:images/1862.png[] *(Add a new Chargeback Rate)*.
. Type in a *Description* for the chargeback rate.
. Select *Euro* for currency.
. For each item that you want to set, select the time, and fill in the range and rates. For this example, in the *Allocated CPU Count*, configure:
* In *Per Time*, select *Hourly*.
* In *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* remains as `0.0` and *Finish* is `2`.
* In *Rate*, specify `1` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.5` for the *Variable* rate.
* Click *Add* under *Actions* to create a new, blank *Allocated CPU Count* line.
* In the new line in *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* is `2` and *Finish* is `4`.
* In *Rate*, specify `0.8` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.4` for the *Variable* rate.
* Click *Add* under *Actions* to create another new, blank *Allocated CPU Count* line.
* In the new line in *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* is `4` and leave *Finish* as `Infinity`.
* In *Rate*, specify `0.6` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.2` for *Variable*.

* Click *Add* at the bottom of the screen to save the chargeback rate.

The rate can now be assigned.
