Prometheus is used as an external alerting component. {product-title_short} integrates Prometheus alerts for use with OpenShift Container Platform. {product-title_short} collects events from Prometheus, generates alerts based on these events, and then attaches alerts to inventory objects.

It is possible to view ongoing alerts in {product-title_short} by navigating to menu:Monitor[Alerts] and manage their life cycle, including the ability to:

* View active alerts per provider in the *Overview* screen.
* View alert data and related objects.
* Comment, assign, and acknowledge alerts in the *All Alerts* screen.

=== Configuring Prometheus Alerts in {product-title_short}

Configuring and enabling Prometheus alerts in {product-title_short} comprises the following steps:

. Deploying and configuring Prometheus on OpenShift.
. Assigning Prometheus alert profiles to the enterprise in {product-title_short}.
. Adding an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus alert endpoint in {product-title_short}.

==== Deploying and Configuring Prometheus on OpenShift

. Deploy Prometheus on OpenShift by following the steps covered in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/install_config/cluster_metrics.html#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus on OpenShift Container Platform].
. Add Prometheus to an OpenShift cluster and configure alert definitions. See the example code block below for configuring alerts (currently must be done on the Prometheus side):
+
----
$ oc edit configmap -n openshift-metrics prometheus
# Supported annotations:
# severity: ERROR|WARNING|INFO. defaults to ERROR.
# miqTarget: ContainerNode|ExtManagementSystem, defaults to ContainerNode.
# miqIgnore: "true|false", should ManageIQ pick up this alert, defaults to true.
  prometheus.rules: |
    groups:
    - name: example-rules
      interval: 30s # defaults to global interval
      rules:
      - alert: "NodeDown" << Alert starts here
        expr: up{job="kubernetes-nodes"} == 0
        annotations:
          miqTarget: "ContainerNode"
          severity: "ERROR"
          url: "https://www.example.com/node_down_fixing_instructions"
          message: "Node {{$labels.instance}} is down"
      - alert: "TooManyRequests"
        expr: rate(authenticated_user_requests[2m]) > 12
        annotations:
          miqTarget: "ExtManagementSystem"
          severity: "ERROR"
          url: "https://www.example.com/too_many_requests_fixing_instructions"
          message: "Too many authenticated requests"

----

. Reload the Prometheus configuration. You can do this by deleting the Prometheus pod, then redeploying with the new configuration.

==== Assigning Prometheus Alert Profiles to the Enterprise

Complete the following procedure to assign Prometheus alert profiles to the enterprise using the {product-title_short} user interface.

[NOTE]
====
Both Node and Provider alert profiles are created automatically during the installation, so it is not required to create these profiles.
====

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer], then click *Alert Profiles* in the accordion menu.
. Click to expand *Node Alert Profiles*, then click *Prometheus Node Profile*. 
. Click image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click image:1851.png[] (*Edit assignments for this Alert Profile*). Assign the profile to *The Enterprise* from the *Assign To* list.
. Click *Save*.
. Click to expand *Provider Alert Profiles*, then click *Prometheus Provider Profile*. 
. Click *Configuration*, then click *Edit assignments for this Alert Profile*. Assign the profile to *The Enterprise* from the *Assign To* list.
. Click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alerts triggered before assigning the profiles to the enterprise will not appear in {product-title_short} at all.
====

==== Adding an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus Alert Endpoint

Complete the following procedure using the {product-title_short} user interface to add an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus alert endpoint.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[Add New Containers Provider] (*Add New Containers Provider*).
. Enter a *Name* for the provider.
. From the *Type* list, select *OpenShift Container Platform*.
. Enter the appropriate *Zone* for the provider. If you do not specify a zone, it is set to `default`.
. From the *Alerts* list, select *Prometheus* to enable external alerts. Selecting *Prometheus* adds an *Alerts* tab to the lower pane to configure the Prometheus alerts service. Alerts are disabled by default.
. From the *Metrics* list, select *Prometheus* to enable external metrics. Selecting *Prometheus* adds a *Metrics* tab to the lower pane to configure the Prometheus metrics service.
. In the *Default* tab, add the default endpoints for the OpenShift provider: 
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate and paste into the *Trusted CA Certificates* box, in PEM format.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider's CA certificate for all endpoints (default, metrics, alerts) at `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt`. Paste the output (a block of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into the *Trusted CA Certificates* field.
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely (not recommended).
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *Hostname* must use a unique fully qualified domain name.
====
+
.. Enter the *API Port* of the provider. The default port is `8443`.
.. Enter a token for your provider in the *Token* box.
+
[NOTE]
====
To obtain a token for your provider, run the `oc get secret` command on your provider; see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6-beta/html-single/managing_providers/#Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token[Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token].

For example:

# oc get secret --namespace management-infra management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode
====
+
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title_short} can connect to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.
. In the *Metrics* tab, add the Prometheus metrics endpoint:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the service:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate and paste into the *Trusted CA Certificates* box, in PEM format.
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address). 
.. Enter the *API Port* if your Prometheus provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title_short} can connect to the metrics.
. In the *Alerts* tab, add the Prometheus alerts endpoint:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the service:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate and paste into the *Trusted CA Certificates* box, in PEM format.
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) or alert *Route*. 
.. Enter the *API Port* if your Prometheus provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title_short} can connect to the alerts service.
. Click *Add*.
