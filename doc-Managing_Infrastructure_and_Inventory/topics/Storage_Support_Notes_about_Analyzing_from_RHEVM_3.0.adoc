= SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 - Storage Support Notes

There are two additional steps required to perform a SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 using `iSCSI` or `FCP` storage.
NFS storage does not have these requirements.


. Enable `DirectLUN` support for the host and {product-title} appliance that performs the analysis.
+
* Enable `DirectLUN` on host.
* Enable `DirectLUN` on the {product-title} appliance.
To do this, edit the desired Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization storage and get the `LUNID` value.
Then, on the {product-title} appliance virtual machine in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization user interface, right-click and select menu:Edit[Custom Properties] and enter the following in the *Custom Properties* edit box:
+
----
directlun=<LUN ID>:readonly
----
+
If you have multiple storage domains, separate them by a comma, similar to:  
+
----
directlun=<LUN ID 1>:readonly,<LUN ID 2>:readonly,<LUN ID N>:readonly
----
+
[NOTE]
======
The {product-title} appliance must reside in the same data center as the storage you are trying to connect.
If you have multiple data centers with `iSCSI` or `FCP` storage, you need a {product-title} appliance in each data center to support virtual machine scanning.
======

. *Set Server Relationship* - This is required to allow the virtual machine SmartState analysis job to determine which data center a {product-title} appliance is running and therefore identify what storage it has access to in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

.. After setting up a {product-title} appliance and performing a refresh of the Provider, find the {product-title} appliance in the *Virtual Machine* accordion list and view its summary screen.

.. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2146.png[](*Edit Server Relationship*).

.. Select the server that relates to this instance of the {product-title} appliance.
