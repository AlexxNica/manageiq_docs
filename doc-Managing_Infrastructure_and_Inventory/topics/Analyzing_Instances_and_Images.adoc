= Analyzing Instances and Images

Analyze an instance to collect metadata such as user accounts, applications, software patches, and other internal information.
If {product-title} is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual analysis of an instance.
To perform a SmartState Analysis, {product-title} requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the instance's storage location.
