= VMware Networking Switches

After adding a VMware provider, {product-title} automatically discovers all vSphere distributed switches (vDS) on that provider and collects the information in the {product-title} inventory.

Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Networking] to see a list of all VMware switches, along with information including _Name_, _Ports_, and _UUID_. Switches and port groups are listed by provider, then cluster on the sidebar.

Click on a switch to view its summary page, which displays relationships with hosts, and any tags.
