== Configuring Automatic Tagging for Container Entities

Container object labels in OpenShift Container Platform can be used to automatically create tags in {product-title}. This is done by mapping existing OpenShift labels to {product-title} tags and tag categories.

Labels from OpenShift can be mapped to {product-title} tags for the following container entities:

* Projects
* Nodes
* Routes
* Replicators
* Container services
* Pods
* Container builds

Note that tags created by this method are completely managed by the system and cannot be manually assigned or unassigned.
Deleting a mapping rule immediately deletes the resulting tags.

View a container entity's OpenShift labels on container entities on the entity's details page. OpenShift labels are listed under the *Labels* heading.

To configure automatic tagging on container entities using OpenShift labels:

. Note the OpenShift label you want to map to a {product-title} tag. To find the label:
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Nodes].
.. Select a node to open its summary page.
.. Under *Labels*, note the label(s) to map to {product-title} tag(s). For example, this node has six labels that were created in OpenShift and collected in CloudForms inventory:

[NOTE]
====
To create an OpenShift label, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[Developer CLI Operations] in the OpenShift Container Platform _CLI Reference_ guide. A new label added in OpenShift will only show up in {product-title} after the next OpenShift provider refresh.

. Navigate to *Configuration* and select the region.
. Click the *Map Tags* tab.
. Click *Add* to create a new mapping rule.
.. Select a container entity to tag from the *Entity* list, or select *<All>* to tag all entities.
.. Specify the OpenShift container label you noted in the previous step in *Label*. 
.. Specify a {product-title} tag category in *Category* to map the label to. If the tag category does not exist yet in {product-title}, it will be created automatically.

.. Click *Add*.
The mapping will show in the table on the *Map Tags* tab.

. Refresh the provider to complete the mapping:
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
.. Select the provider to refresh.
.. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2003.png[] (*Refresh Items and Relationships*).

The container label will display on the entity's summary page under *Smart Management* under *Company Tags*.

You can use the tags to create reports. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.2-beta/single/monitoring-alerts-and-reporting/[Monitoring, Alerts, and Reporting] for details on creating reports.
