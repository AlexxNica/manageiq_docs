Through {product-title}, you can perform a _Compute scale down_ on a Red Hat OpenStack infrastructure provider. This process involves decreasing its Compute nodes used by an OpenStack infrastructure provider. Doing so involves putting a Compute node into _maintenance mode_ and removing it from the provider afterwards. Once a node is in maintenance mode, it can be repurposed (for examle, re-provision it as a Controller node), repaired, or decommissioned altogether.

Before scaling down, evacuate or migrate any instances hosted on the node you are removing. For instructions on either procedure, see xref:_to_live_migrate_an_instance[] or xref:_to_evacuate_an_instance[].

After migrating or evacuating instances from the node, set the node to maintenance mode. To do so:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Hosts].
. Click the OpenStack compute node to be removed from the provider.
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:1851.png[] (*Toggle Maintenance Mode*).

[NOTE]
=========================
This option can only be used with OpenStack providers with at least two Compute nodes.
=========================

Repeat this procedure for every node you want to remove from the cloud provider. 

After setting a Compute node to maintenance mode, you can scale down its provider:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Providers].

. Click the provider to be scaled down.

. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:1851.png[] (*Scale Down*). 

. From the *Scale Infrastructure Provider Down* section, check the nodes to be removed from the provider. You can only do this for nodes where *Maintenance* is set to *true*.

. Click *Scale Down*.
