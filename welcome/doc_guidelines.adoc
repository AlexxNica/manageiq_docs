== Directory and file naming conventions

All topic directory groups and topic filenames must be lowercase, and must not include whitespace, in order for the build system work correctly. Refer to the following example:

....
/
/topic_dir
/topic_dir/topic_1.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_2.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_3.adoc
....

== Topic Files

Every topic file should contain the following metadata at the top, with no line spacing in between, except where noted:

----
= Document/Topic Title                                          <1>
{product-author}                                                <2>
{product-version}                                               <3>
:data-uri:                                                      <4>
:icons:                                                         <5>
:toc:                                                           <6>
:toc-placement!:                                                <7>
:toc-title: Topics Covered                                      <8>
:description: <Brief description of content for search>         <9>
-----------intentional blank line--------------
toc::[]                                                         <10>
----

<1> Human readable title of document/topic title line (notice the '=' top-level header)
<2> AsciiDoctor attribute for product author and gets dynamically replaced 
<3> AsciiDoctor attribute for product version and gets dynamically replaced 
<4> AsciiDoctor attribute to embed all images directly in the HTML 
<5> AsciiDoctor attribute for icons used in admonitions and such (TIP, NOTE, WARNING, etc.)
<6> Adds a table of contents (TOC).
<7> Overrides the default placement of TOC.
<8> Overrides the default title of TOC.
<9> Brief description or synopsis of the document/topic to help with Google search.
<10> Placement of the TOC.

After the heading block and a single whitespace line, you can include any content for the topic.

[NOTE]
====
The topic title, which is the first line of the document, is the only level 1 ( = ) title. Section headers within the topic must be level 2 ( == ) or lower.
====

If using section anchors, they must be all lowercase letters, with no line spaces between the anchor and the section title:

----
[[section_anchor_name]]
=== Section Title
----

== Links, hyperlinks, and cross references

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly descriptor]
----

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_ changing the text from the actual URL, just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end; it will automatically be rendered as a link.

If you want to link to another topic in the same topic group directory:

----
link:<filename>[friendly title]
----

Do not use the `.adoc` file extension. The document processor will correctly link this to the resulting HTML file. 

There probably are two scenarios for linking to other content: 

1. Link to another topic file that exists in a separate topic group, or directory.
2. Link to another topic file that exists in the same topic group, or directory.

The following examples use the example directory structure shown here:
....
/
/foo
/foo/bar.adoc
/baz
/baz/zig.adoc
/baz/zag.adoc
....

If you are working on `bar.adoc` and you want to link to `zig.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:../baz/zig[see the ZIG manual for more]
----

Note there is no suffix with the filename. (`.adoc` or `.html`)

If you are working on `zig.adoc` and want to link to `zag.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:zag[comment]
----

This type of linking should be sufficient in most cases. However, you can also link to a subtopic within a topic file:

----
link:../baz/zig/#subtopic
----

If you want to link to an image:

1. Put it in `<topic_dir>/images`
2. In the topic document, use this format to link to an image:

----
image:<name_of_image>[image]
----

You only need to specify `<name_of_image>`. The build mechanism automatically specifies the file path. 

== Conditional text between products
OpenShift documentation uses the AsciiDoc `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize document segments for specific OpenShift distributions down to the single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the OpenShift build mechanism are: 

* _openshift-origin_
* _openshift-online_
* _openshift-enterprise_

These attributes can be used by themselves, or in conjunction to conditionalize text within a topic document.

Here is an example of this concept in use:

....
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear for all versions.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
This line will appear for OpenShift Origin and Enterprise, but not for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]
....


Note that the following limitations exist when conditionalizing text:

1. The `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, however they should not be used to conditionalize an entire topic. If an entire topic file is specific to a given OpenShift distribution, refer to the Document Set Metadata section for information on how to conditionalize at the whole-topic level.

2. The `ifdef/endif` blocks cannot be nested. In other words, one conditional block cannot contain other conditional blocks.

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

=== Code blocks

For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block.

Acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Not acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Without the line spaces the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

Also, if you want to render some code inline, use backticks:

....
"The file can be found at `/dev/null` on your host."
....

Which renders as:

"The file can be found at `/dev/null` on your host."

=== Lists
Lists are created as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This will render as such:

. Item 1

. Item 2

. Item 3

If you need to add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you need to add the continuous +, as shown in the example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as shown:

. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3

=== Examples

Use the following format when showing examples:

....
.Example Title
----
Example text here
----
....


== Admonitions

Admonitions such as notes and warnings are formatted as shown:

....
[ADMONITION]
====
Text for admonition
====
....

== Quick markup reference

[cols="4,7"]
|===
|Markup |Description

|$$`rhc app create`$$
|Inline commands, for example:

Use the `rhc app create` command to create a new application.

|$$[parameter]#MAX_GEARS#$$
|System or software parameters:

Set the [parameter]#MAX_GEARS# parameter to the desired value.

|$$[userinput]#value#$$
|Values that a user is asked to enter:

Type [userinput]#Yes# when prompted.

|$$[replaceable]#<Name>#$$
a|This represents text that a user must replace with an actual value. For example:

`rhc app delete [replaceable]#<App_Name>#`
