[NOTE]
======
You can only schedule a host analysis for connected virtual machines, not repository virtual machines that were discovered through that host. Since repository virtual machines do not retain a relationship with the host that discovered them, there is no current way to scan them through
the scheduling feature. The host is shown because it may have connected virtual machines in the future when the schedule is set to run.
