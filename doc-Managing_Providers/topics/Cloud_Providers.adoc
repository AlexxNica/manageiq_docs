In {product-title_short}, a cloud provider is a cloud computing environment that you can add to a {product-title_short} appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This chapter describes the different types of cloud providers that you can add to {product-title_short}, and how to manage them. Cloud providers can be either discovered automatically by {product-title_short}, or added individually.

Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider.
