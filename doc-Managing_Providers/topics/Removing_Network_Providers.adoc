= Removing Network Providers

Although network providers are added or removed automatically upon adding or removing the respective cloud provider, you can manually remove a network provider if it is no longer in use. This will remove the network provider from the VMDB and any relationship with the cloud provider.

. Navigate to menu:Networks[Providers].
. Click the network provider to remove.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2098.png[Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB] (*Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB*).
. Click *OK*.
