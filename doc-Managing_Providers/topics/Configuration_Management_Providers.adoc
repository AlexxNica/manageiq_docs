[[configuration_management_providers]]
= Configuration Management Providers

EDIT THUMBNAIL AND EXPLANATION (THIS FROM INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS)

In {product-title_short}, a configuration management provider is a (?virtual infrastructure environment) that you can add to a {product-title_short} appliance to manage your resources. These configuration systems are used for recording and reporting status and change activity for these configuration items. Configuration management providers are useful for uniformly applying changes and updates across providers, and can help eliminate the confusion and error brought about by the existence of different providers. 

This chapter describes the different types of configuration management providers available to {product-title_short}, and how to manage them. Configuration management providers must be added individually to {product-title_short}.

(EDIT)

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent providers.
Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider.

== Red Hat Satellite 6

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them using a set of Puppet modules. {product-title} provides functionality to integrate with a Red Hat Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its features. This includes:

* Monitoring the inventory of your Red Hat Satellite 6 server, including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.
* Reprovisioning existing bare metal system hosts to new host groups.
* Applying {product-title} policy tags to hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only reprovisions existing systems in a Red Hat Satellite 6 environment. Provisioning systems from Red Hat Satellite 6's bare metal discovery service is planned for a future release.
