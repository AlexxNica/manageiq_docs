= Viewing a Provider

From a list of providers, you can review a specific provider by clicking on it. This displays various options to access provider information. 

There are two methods of viewing an infrastructure provider's details: the summary screen (default) and the dashboard screen. Use the summary image:Summary.png[] and dashboard image:Dashboard.png[] buttons to toggle between views.

Both the summary and dashboard screens contain a taskbar with *Reload*, *Configuration*, *Policy*, *Monitoring*, and *Authentication* buttons to manage the selected provider.
