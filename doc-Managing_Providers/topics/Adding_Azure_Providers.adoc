= Adding Azure Providers

{product-title} supports Microsoft Azure providers. Before {product-title_short} can be authenticated to Microsoft Azure, you must complete a series of prerequisite steps using the Azure portal; see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/[Create Active Directory application and service principal account using the Azure portal]. Follow the steps to set up an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and assign the required permissions to it, then create an Azure Active Directory application, and obtain the *Application ID* (Client ID), *Directory ID* (Tenant ID), *Subscription ID*, and *Key Value* (Client Key) that are required to add and connect to the Azure instance as a provider in {product-title_short}. Currently, all of these steps can be performed using either the Azure Resource Manager or Service Manager (Classic) mode. 

[NOTE]
====
When following the prerequisite steps using the Azure portal:

* The *Application ID* obtained during _Get Application ID and Authentication Key_ is your *Client ID*. In the same section, after providing a description and a duration for the key, the *VALUE* displayed after clicking *Save* is your *Client Key*. If you choose an expiring key, make sure to note the expiration date, as you will need to generate a new key before that day in order to avoid an interruption.

* The *Directory ID* obtained during _Get Tenant ID_ is your *Tenant ID*.

* During _Assign Application to Role_, select the *Contributor* role and not the *Reader* role.

* To obtain your *Subscription ID*, log in to the Azure portal and click *Subscriptions* on the slide-out menu on the left. Find the appropriate subscription and see your Azure *Subscription ID* associated with it. The Azure *Subscription ID* is like a billing unit for all of the services consumed in your Azure account, including virtual machines and storage. The *Subscription ID* is in the form of a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).

So, after a service principal account (instance of an application in a directory) has been created using the Azure portal, the following four pieces of information will be available within the Azure Active Directory (AAD) module.

* Directory ID (Tenant ID)
* Subscription ID
* Application ID (Client ID)
* Client Key

You can then use these values in the procedure below to add an Azure cloud instance as a provider to {product-title_short}.
