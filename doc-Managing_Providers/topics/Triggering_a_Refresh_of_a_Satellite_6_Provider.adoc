= Triggering a Refresh of a Satellite 6 Provider

Your Satellite 6 provider can still create new hosts independently of {product-title}. Your {product-title} appliance detects these changes after an automatic refresh period. However, you can trigger a manual refresh to avoid waiting for the automatic refresh.

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Management].
. Select your Red Hat Satellite 6 provider using the checkbox, and click menu:Configuration[Refresh Relationships and Power States]. This triggers the refresh.
. When the refresh is complete, select the Red Hat Satellite 6 provider to check the updated list of hosts groups in the provider.
