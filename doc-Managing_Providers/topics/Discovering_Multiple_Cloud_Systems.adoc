= Discovering Cloud Providers

TEST THIS!

In addition to individually adding providers, you can also discover all cloud providers in a given subnet range.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Cloud > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1942.png[Discover Cloud Providers] (*Discover Cloud Providers*). 
. Select the types of provider to discover.
. Enter a *Subnet Range* of IP addresses starting with a *From Address* and ending with a *To Address*. The cursor automatically advances as you complete each octet.
. Click *Start*.

The appliance searches for all cloud providers in the specified subnet range, and adds them to the user interface. However, before you can manage the providers added via discovery, you must edit each provider and specify authentication details.
