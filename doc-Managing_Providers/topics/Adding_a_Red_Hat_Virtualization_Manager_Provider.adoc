The following are required to collect capacity and utilization data from a Red Hat Virtualization provider:

- In {product-title_short}, the capacity and utilization server roles must be enabled. Enable these roles from the settings menu, in menu:Configuration[Server > Server Control]. For more information on capacity and utilization collection, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5-beta/html-single/deployment_planning_guide/#assigning_the_capacity_and_utilization_server_roles[Assigning the Capacity and Utilization Server Roles] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_.
- In the Red Hat Virtualization environment, the Data Warehouse and Reports components must be installed in that environment, and you must create a {product-title} user in the Data Warehouse database:
* To install the Data Warehouse and Reports components in a Red Hat Virtualization environment, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/paged/installation-guide/[Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide].
* To create a {product-title} user in the Data Warehouse database, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.5/deployment-planning-guide/#data_collection_for_rhev_33_34[Data Collection for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.3 and 3.4] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_.
