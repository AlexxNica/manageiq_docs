= Permissions for Amazon EC2 Providers

Red Hat recommends using Amazon EC2's _Power User_ IAM policy when adding Amazon EC2 as a cloud provider in {product-title}.
This policy allows those in the _Power User_ group full access to AWS services except for user administration, meaning a {product-title} API user would be able to access all of the API functionality, but would not be able to access or change user
permissions.

Further limiting API access limitations begins to limit what can be done in Automate, as Automate
scripts can directly access the AWS SDK to create brand new
application functionality.

The following permissions are required in Amazon EC2 accounts to use as a provider in {product-title}:

The AWS services primarily accessed by {product-title} API are:

* EC2
* CloudFormation
* CloudWatch
* ElasticLoadBalancing
* SNS
* SQS
