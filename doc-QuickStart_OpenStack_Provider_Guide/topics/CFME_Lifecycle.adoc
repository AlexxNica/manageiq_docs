== {product-title_short} Lifecycle Management

This chapter discusses lifecycle activities that are part of the _{product-title}_ Automate component; these activies can include the provisioning and retirement of instances. _{product-title}_ Automate enables real-time, bidirectional process integration and adaptive automation for management events and administrative or operational activities.

* *Operations Management* with service level resource enforcement.
* *Resource Management* - including datastore cleanup, snapshot aging and enforcement, and virtual machine/instance aging and retirement.
* *Configuration and Change Management* - including enforced closed loop change management.
* *Lifecycle Management* - including provisioning, customization, reconfiguration, approval, CMDB updates, and retirement.

[IMPORTANT]
======
Provisioning requires that the *Automation Engine* server role be enabled. Check your server role settings in `Configure > Configuration > Server > Server Control`.

=== Provisioning

When a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through multiple phases:

* *Phase 1* - the request must be made, and includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization of the request. 
* *Phase 2* - the request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual. 
* *Phase 3* - the request is executed. This part of provisioning consists of pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses for the user, creates CMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine or instance based on information in the request. Post-processing activates the CMDB instance and emails the user. The steps for provisioning may be modified at any time using _{product-title}_.
