This guide walks you through adding a Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise cluster to a {product-title} container provider catalog. This deployment focuses on enabling the OpenShift Enterprise cluster metrics plug-in, so that {product-title_short} can collect information from an OpenShift Enterprise cluster upon integration.

Each procedure in this guide is covered in greater detail in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/[{product-title}] and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/[OpenShift Enterprise] product documentation. However, links to the corresponding sections are provided for more detail.

The following sections will describe the required configuration for both products prior to integration.
