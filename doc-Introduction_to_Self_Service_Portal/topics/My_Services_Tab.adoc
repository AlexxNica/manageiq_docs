== The My Services Tab

The *My Services* tab lists all available services with a summary of information associated with each service, including *Service Name*, *Retirement Date*, *Number of VMs*, *Owner*, the date it was *Created On*, and its *Power State*. You can filter or sort services by those entities, and now also by *Relative Cost*. There is now the ability for users to perform power operations on virtual machines within the Self Service user interface using the new set of buttons, *Start*, *Stop*, and *Suspend* for each service.

There is now ability for users to view chargeback data per service for the virtual machines' month-to-date usage. You can also get HTML 5 console access to the virtual machine by clicking the image:SSUI_html5_icon.png[Html 5 Icon] button, as highlighted on the screen capture. On the same screen, you also have options to retire the service now or at a later date, edit or remove the service. Additionally, you can now change the ownership and group of the service using the *Set Ownership* button, and also *Reconfigure* a service, similar to in the full administrative user interface.

=== Cockpit Integration

Cockpit is an interactive Linux server administrative interface. You can perform simple administration tasks such as starting containers, storage administration, network configuration, and inspecting logs. While cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time, your browser connects to a primary server that runs the Cockpit web service through which connections to additional servers can be established.
