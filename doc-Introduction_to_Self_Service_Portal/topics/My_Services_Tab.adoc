Click on a service to view further details including information on the virtual machines associated with it. You can also get HTML 5 console access to the virtual machine by clicking the button, as highlighted on the screen capture. On the same screen, you also have options to retire the service now or at a later date, edit or remove the service. Additionally, you can now change the ownership and group of the service using the *Set Ownership* button, and also *Reconfigure* a service, similar to in the full administrative user interface.

=== Cockpit Integration

Cockpit is an interactive Linux server admin interface. You can perform simple administration tasks such as starting containers, storage administration, network configuration, inspecting logs and so on. While cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time, your browser connects to a primary server that runs the Cockpit web service through which connections to additional servers can be established.

{product-title} full administrative user interface and the Self Service user interface have enabled for users to click the new Cockpit button image:SSUI_Cockpit-Button.png[Cockpit Button] that opens a new browser window with Cockpit interface for a given virtual machine. 

[NOTE]
====
Cockpit must be pre-configured and running on the virtual machine.

If you get a security warning by the browser, you will need to add this connection to the security exceptions. Click *Advanced → Add Exception → Confirm Security Exception*. After that, you will see the login screen.
