== The My Services Tab

The *My Services* tab lists all available services with a summary of information associated with each service, including *Service Name*, *Retirement Date*, *Number of VMs*, *Owner* and the date it was *Created On*. You can filter or sort the services listed by those values.

Click on a service to view further details including information on the virtual machines associated with it. You can also get HTML 5 console access to the virtual machine by clicking the button, as highlighted on the screen capture. On the same screen, you also have options to retire the service now or at a later date, edit or remove the service. Additionally, you can now change the ownership and group of the service using the *Set Ownership* button, and also *Reconfigure* a service, similar to in the full administrative user interface.

Moreover, you can now add custom buttons and custom button groups that can have dialogs associated with them. For example:

CloudForms now also has the ability for users to click a new image:SSUI_Cockpit-Button.png[Cockpit Button] button that opens a new browser window with Cockpit interface for a given virtual machine. Note this requires that Cockpit is pre-configured and running on the virtual machine.
