== Services Tab

The *Services* tab lists all available services with a summary of information associated with each service, including the *Service Name*, its current *Power State* represented by an icon, *Number of VMs*, *Owner*, date *Created*, and *Retires* date. Additionally, you can see the chargeback cost per service for a virtual machine's month-to-date usage. You can filter or sort services by those entities, and by *Relative Cost*. 

On the same screen, you have the option to edit the service name and description, edit tags, set ownership, retire the service now or at a later date, or remove the service. You can also perform power operations on virtual machines by clicking more options _(represented by three dots)_ next to the service.
