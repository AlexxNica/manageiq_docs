== Navigating the Self Service User Interface

The Self Service user interface has a slideout navigation menu on the left that can be minimized by clicking on the menu icon (â‰¡) on top, like in the full administrative user interface. The slideout navigation menu comprises of the following tabs:

* *Dashboard*
* *My Services*
* *My Requests* 
* *Service Catalog*
* *Designer*
* *Administration*  

[NOTE]
====
Clicking on the arrow icon image:SSUI_popout_arrow.png[Popout Arrow] at the top of the user interface will take you to the full administrative user interface login page, in a new browser window/tab.

There are several options in the top-right corner of the user interface, including a shopping cart, notifications banner, and a help option. Besides that, you can see the current logged in LDAP user, for example, *Administrator*. As the Self Service user interface supports role-based access control of menus and features, if you are a member of multiple user groups, you can change the acting group by navigating to *_Administrator_* > *Change Group*, then select the new group from the available options in the list.

Although you can choose your preferred language for the user interface on the login screen, there is an option to switch to a different language from the list than what is currently set by navigating to *_Administrator_* > *Switch Language* after logging into the Self Service user interface.
