Notifications::

The Self Service user interface has introduced a new notifications feature that displays messages generated by the system for various events, such as adding service to shopping cart, ordering services, provisioning, service power operations and so on. Click the bell icon to open or close the *Notification* drawer, that shows various notification events.

Help::

Click *About* to see information about your Self Service environment, such as the logged in user name and role, the browser details, and more importantly, the version number of your Self Service user interface, which can be useful for support purposes.

Role-Based Access Control::

The Self Service user interface supports role-based access control of menus and features. If you are a member of multiple user groups, you can change the acting group by navigating to *_Administrator_* > *Change Group*, then select the new group from the available options in the list.
