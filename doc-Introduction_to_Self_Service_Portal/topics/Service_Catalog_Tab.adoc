== The Service Catalog Tab

The *Service Catalog* tab lists all service catalog items, displayed as tiles. These items must be configured on the administrative user interface before they will be accessible to the user here. You can filter or sort the service catalog items by *Name*, *Description* and *Catalog Name*.

Click on a service to open up the page where you will enter the requested information in the dialog fields associated with the service, as previously configured in the administrative user interface. Note that there is now an ability to add dynamic dialog elements within the Self Service user interface, meaning you can include a particular dialog field where {product-title} will communicate to the instance and method, obtain the required information, and enter the value in the field dynamically. After you have all information in the requested dialog parameters, click *Add to Shopping Cart*.

*Shopping Cart Model:*

The Self Service user interface has adopted a shopping cart model for ordering services, instead of ordering them immediately. Click on the shopping cart icon at the top to view all services added to the shopping cart that are available to order. You can delete a particular service from the cart if required, and order the services in the cart all at one time. Or, you can even choose to clear all the services in the cart and exit.
