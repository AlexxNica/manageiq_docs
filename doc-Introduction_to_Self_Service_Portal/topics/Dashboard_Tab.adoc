== The Dashboard Tab

Once you log in to the Self Service user interface, you will see the dashboard screen by default. The *Dashboard* tab provides a quick summary of the services available, requests made, and their statuses as below:

* Total Services
* Current (Active) Services
* Services Retiring Soon
* Retired Services
* Total Requests
* Pending Requests
* Approved Requests
* Denied Requests

The slideout navigation menu on the left can be minimized by clicking on the menu icon (â‰¡) on top, like in the full administrative user interface. The *My Services*, *My Requests*, and *Service Catalog* tabs on the navigation menu show counts of respective items. 

As the Self Service user interface supports role-based access control of menus and features, if you are a member of multiple user groups, you can change the acting group by clicking on the current LDAP user group at the top-right corner of the user interface, *_Administrator_* > *Change Group*, then select the new group from the available options.

Clicking on the arrow icon (image:SSUI_popout_arrow.png[Popout Arrow]) at the top of the user interface will take you to the full administrative user interface login page, in a new browser window/tab.
