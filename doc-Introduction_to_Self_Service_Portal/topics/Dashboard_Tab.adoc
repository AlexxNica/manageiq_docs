Monthly Charges - This Month To Date::

The Self Service user interface now shows on the dashboard the total monthly charges of the services' usage in dollar amount. This provides a quick summary of where you are from cost standpoint of service usage charges to that point in the month. 

[NOTE]
====
If you are on the first day of the month, there can be no data yet therefore resulting in zero dollar amount. Also, if you have a lot of data, it might not have rolled into the new month yet, resulting in no data and dollar amount for month to date.
