To allow {product-title} to receive events from a Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment, you must configure the *notification_driver* option for the Compute service and Orchestration service in that environment. To do so, edit _undercloud.conf_, and set _store_events_ to _true_ before installing the undercloud. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/director-installation-and-usage/#chap-Installing_the_Undercloud[Installing the Undercloud] and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/director-installation-and-usage/#sect-Configuring_the_Director[Configuring the Director] in Red Hat OpenStack Platform _Director Installation and Usage_ for related details.
