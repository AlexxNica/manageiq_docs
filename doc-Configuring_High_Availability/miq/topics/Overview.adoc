[[Overview]]
== Environment Overview

A {product-title} environment is comprised of an engine tier and a database tier. Redundancy is imparted on both tiers for high availability.

There are two failover mechanisms providing high availability: the _repmgr_ tool and a failover monitor.

_repmgr_ row-oriented replication provides the PostgreSQL database tier redundancy, which operates in a primary-hot standby manner. The data replication is asynchronous and in the event of primary database failure, the standby database assumes the role of primary, orchestrated by the _repmgr_ tool. The engine appliance is connected to both the primary and standby databases, and can then continue running normally even in the case of a node failure.

[NOTE]
====
In the current version of {product-title}, manual steps are required to reintroduce the failed database node back as the standby server. See xref:reintroducing_the_failed_node[].
====

The redundant engine appliances are load balanced using HAProxy or another load balancer solution.

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements

For a high availability {product-title} environment, you need a virtualization host containing at minimum four virtual machines with {product-title} installed, consisting of:

- One virtual machine for the primary external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- One virtual machine for the standby external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- Two virtual machines for the {product-title} engine appliances

See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.2/paged/deployment-planning-guide/chapter-2-planning[Planning] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_ for information on setting up the correct disk space for the database appliances.
endif::cfme[]

[NOTE]
====
You must use the same {product-title} appliance template for virtual machines created for the engine appliances, as well as for the database servers.

See the https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat Customer Portal] for the appliance download appropriate to the platform on which you are running {product-title}.
