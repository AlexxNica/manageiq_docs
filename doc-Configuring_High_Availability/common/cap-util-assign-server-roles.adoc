. Navigate to menu:Settings[Configuration], and select the server to configure from menu:Settings[Zone] in the left pane of the appliance.
. Navigate to the *Server Roles* list in the menu:Server[Server Control] section. From there, set the appropriate Capacity and Utilization roles to *ON*. Namely:
.. *Capacity & Utilization Coordinator*
.. *Capacity & Utilization Data Collector*
.. *Capacity & Utilization Data Processor*
. Click *Save*.

Data collection is enabled immediately. However, the first collection begins
5 minutes after the server is started, and every 10 minutes after that.
Therefore, the longest the collection takes after enabling the Capacity &
Utilization collector server role is 10 minutes. The first collection
from a particular provider may take a few minutes since {product-title}
is gathering data points going one month back in time.
