== Creating an Action to Assign Profile to Analysis Task

Actions are performed after the condition is evaluated. You can associate actions with specific events when you create a policy. {product-title} comes with a set of default actions. Additionally, you can create custom actions using the {product-title_short} user interface. 

Use this procedure to create a custom action by adding the *Assign Profile to Analysis Task* action type to the virtual machine analysis profile (created in _Creating a Virtual Machine Analysis Profile_).
