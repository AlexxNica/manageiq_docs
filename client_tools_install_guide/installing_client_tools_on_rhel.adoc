== Overview
You must have the following to successfully install the client tools:

*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or later 
*  Sudoer or root access 
*  Ruby and RubyGems installed (including rubygem-json and rubygem-parseconfig) 

[NOTE]
====
The +sudo+ command only works if the particular user is listed in the *_sudoers_* file. As an alternative to sudo access, you can activate a root terminal with the +su+ command and the root password. If you activate a root terminal, omit `sudo` from the commands shown in the examples. Be sure to close the root terminal after the installation completes. 
====

== Install RubyGems

If the RubyGems package is not already installed, you must enable the Red Hat Enterprise Linux optional repository channel. The RubyGems package dependencies are then automatically resolved when the client tools are installed. 

If you are using the Certificate-Based Red Hat Network (RHN) tooling, use the following command to enable the optional channel:

----
$ sudo yum-config-manager --enable [architecture][operating_system]-optional-6
----

If you are using the classic RHN subscription, use the following command to enable the optional channel:

----
$ sudo rhn-channel --add --channel=[architecture]-[operating_system]-optional-6
----

* _++architecture++_: your system architecture. Enter either _i386_ or _x86_64_
* _++operating system++_: type of operating system installed. Enter either _workstation_ or _server_. 

For example, if you have Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 6 or later installed on a 64-bit x86 computer, and you are using the classic Red Hat Network subscription, run the following command to enable the optional repository:

----
$ sudo rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-x86_64-workstation-optional-6
----

== Install Client Tools

Ensure that the RubyGems software package is installed on your system. Otherwise, the optional repository channel must be enabled on systems that are registered on RHN.

Run the following command to install the client tools:

----
$ sudo gem install rhc
----

Update client tools to the latest version: 

----
$ sudo gem update rhc
----

The following example shows a typical installation on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. Some information has been removed for clarification purposes.

== Installation Issues and Tips 

*Automatic Completion Using the Tab Key*

The OpenShift client tools for Red Hat Enterprise Linux support the automatic completion feature of the bash shell. Run the following command and follow the instructions to enable automatic completion:

----
$ rhc setup --autocomplete
----

You may have to close your current terminal session, and open a new session to automatically source the bash completion script. 

If the automatic completion feature is not persistent when you open a new terminal session, the automatic completion script for the client tools must be sourced in the [flename]#.bashrc# file in your home directory. Do this by adding the following line to to your [flename]#.bashrc# file:

----
source /etc/bash_completion.d/rhc
----

When the installation completes, proceed to link:configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools using the interactive setup wizard.
