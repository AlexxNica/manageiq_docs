== Overview
Install the client tools on Ubuntu or Debian requires sudoer or root access and comprises four steps:

*Step 1*: Install *_Ruby_*  

*Step 2*: Install *_RubyGems_*

*Step 3*: Install *_Git_*

*Step 4*: Install the client tools

[NOTE]
====
The +sudo+ command only works if the particular user is listed in the _sudoers_ file. As an alternative to sudo access, you can activate a root terminal with the +su+ command and the root password. If you activate a root terminal, omit +sudo+ from the commands shown in the examples. Be sure to close the root terminal after the installation completes.

== Installation Issues and Tips

*Execute Client Tool Commands from Any Directory*

On Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions, the client tools by default are stored in the [filename]#/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin# directory. Therefore, all client tool commands must be executed from this directory, and you must prepend [filename]#./# to each command. 

However, this behavior can be changed by adding the client tools to the PATH environment variable so that you can run client tool commands from any directory. Run the following command to add the client tools to the PATH environment variable, and make it persistent for an entire terminal session:  

----
$ sudo export PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin:$PATH
----

Now you can run client tool commands from any directory in the current Terminal session. Note that you must do this each time you close the current Terminal session and start a new one. 

For a more permanent solution, add the `export PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin:$PATH` command to your [flename]#.bashrc# file. Therefore, each time a new Terminal session is started, the client tools are automatically added to the PATH environment variable. You can then run all client tool commands from any directory in Terminal. 


*Make Client Tools Available to All Users*

Initially the OpenShift Online client tools are only available to the user installed them. Run the following command to make the client tools available for all users on an Ubuntu system:

----
$ sudo ln -s /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/rhc* /usr/bin/
----

This creates a symbolic link to the client tools binaries in the default search path, and make the client tools available to all users on that system. 

When the installation completes, proceed to link:configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools using the interactive setup wizard.
