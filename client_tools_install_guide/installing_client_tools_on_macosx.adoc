== Overview
The OpenShift client tools are supported on Mac OS X 10.5 or later and require sudo access.

Installing the client tools on a Mac OS X operating system comprises three steps:


*Step 1*: Install *_Ruby_*

*Step 2*: Install *_Git_* version control

*Step 3*: Install the client tools

== Install Ruby

Mac OS X Lion ships with Ruby 1.8.7 preinstalled. Previous versions of OS X included Ruby as part of the https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode] integrated development environment. If you are installing the client tools on a version of OS X that did not ship with Ruby preinstalled, you can install it one of two ways: 

*  Use the OS X installation CD 
*  Download and install the https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode] integrated development environment from the Apple website 

Alternatively, if you are experienced with Mac OS software development, you can also: 

*  Download and install Ruby from the http://macruby.org/[MacRuby] website, or 
*  Visit http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ for help installing Ruby with homebrew 

After Ruby is installed, run the following command to verify that it has installed correctly:

----
$ ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
Welcome to Ruby
----

== Install Git Version Control

Although there are a number of options available to install Git version control on Mac OS X, Red Hat recommends to download and install the latest version from here: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

When the installation completes,, run the following command to verify that Git has installed correctly:

----
$ git --version
----

This command returns the Git version number that was installed.

== Install the Client Tools

When Ruby and Git have been successfully installed, run the following command to install the client tools:

----
$ sudo gem install rhc
----

When the installation completes, proceed to link:configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools using the interactive setup wizard.
